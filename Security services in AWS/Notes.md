AWS security services provide a comprehensive toolkit for protecting your cloud infrastructure, including Identity and Access Management (IAM), network security (like firewalls and DDoS mitigation), data protection (with encryption and key management), threat detection (GuardDuty), vulnerability management (Inspector), and centralized security posture management (Security Hub). These services address security concerns across different layers of the AWS ecosystem, allowing organizations to maintain compliance, monitor for threats, and secure their data and workloads in a shared responsibility model

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM):
Controls who has access to AWS services and resources by defining users, groups, and permissions.

Amazon Cognito:
Provides identity management for web and mobile applications, enabling users to sign up, sign in, and control access to their app data.

AWS Key Management Service (KMS):
Allows for the centralized creation, management, and auditing of encryption keys to encrypt your data across AWS services.

Amazon GuardDuty:
A managed threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious or unauthorized activity to protect your AWS accounts and workloads.

AWS CloudTrail:
Records all API activities in your AWS account, providing a historical log of who did what, when, and where, which is crucial for security and forensics.

AWS Config:
Tracks the configuration of your AWS resources, helps maintain security standards, and can automate remediation for non-compliant configurations.

AWS Security Hub:
A central dashboard that aggregates security findings from various AWS and third-party services, performs security best practice checks, and helps prioritize and respond to security issues.
